#  Primes Table:

Developped by ROYER-ADNOT Remy a Friday night!

## How to run:

run 'node primes 3' to run the application with "3" as an input.
or 
call 'PrimesTable.init(3)' from JavaScript.

Run `grunt check` for running jshint.
Run `grunt test` for running jasmine tests.
Run `grunt` for running both.

## What I'm pleased with:

I took care of optimizing "IsPrime" algorithm.
The methods "IsPrime", "buildPrimeList", and "drawMultiplicationTable" are reusable and accessible.
All methods are well unit-tested.

## What I would do if I had more time:

An Angular Single Page Application serving a Web Interface to display the primes numbers table as an HTML table.
Web Responsive Design to display all sized table on every device resolution (with eventual scrolling).
